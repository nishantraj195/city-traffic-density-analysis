# City Road Traffic Density Analysis

Minor-1 Project | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Description
This project analyzes city road traffic density to understand traffic patterns, identify peak congestion periods, and classify congestion zones. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques and data visualizations are used to gain insights into traffic behavior. The project is deployed as a public web application using Gradio.

## Objectives
- Analyze traffic density patterns
- Identify peak congestion hours
- Classify congestion zones (Low, Medium, High)
- Visualize traffic trends and heatmaps
- Deploy the project as a web application

## Dataset
A synthetic traffic dataset is used to simulate real-world traffic conditions due to limited access to live city traffic data. This approach is commonly accepted for academic EDA projects.

Dataset attributes:
- Timestamp
- Traffic density
- Hour of day
- Day of week

## Features
- Traffic density distribution analysis
- Time-based trend visualization
- Congestion zone classification
- Heatmap visualization (Hour vs Day)
- Public web deployment

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Gradio
